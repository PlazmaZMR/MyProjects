# MyProjects
i wanna start a digital diary and have my projects up on github ive always wanted to gamedev and realse my first rpg into steam so i wanna learn code and im starting with python rigth now later c, c#, and c++ and i know a bit of html and css i built a website for my mom when i was in 7th grade wasent the best but i was proud and she was aswell. :)


So first road in my virtual roadmap is a text based rpg in python later i wanna make a game with py game and get comfortable enoguh to just be able to make any text based rpg i want in the momment 

day 1 : my pc i spent 350$ and ive always wanted just got surged the power went out about 3-5 times on and off and i had left to go to work in my neighbhors house i clean up the day care she runs and today october 15 2025 she had given a extra project make a little wall with rocks she had around the yard so i did it and yesterday october 14 2025 i did half of it and she had told me the rocks were to small so i had to move the small rocks out the way and bring bigger ones today october 15 2025 and i went to work cleaned at 5 and started on the rock wall project and i ended at 6:30 preety late but i think i did well and hopefully she pays me tommorow but when i got home i was gonna live stream to tiktok and play minecraft but my computer wasent on wich was strange i suspected my mom or stepdad had unplugged it since i wasent home and my pc was on they problobly had gotten mad and uplugged it but i asked her and she said no and that the power went out and my heart dropped i knew what could happen when the power goes out and youre pc is on (everything fries and surges) so i quickly unplugged it and waited for a bit and plugged it in again and it blinked yellow its a dell optiplex 3060 with a 1650 super and 32 gigs of ddr4 ram a 1tb ssd and 350 watt psu this is why it was 350 but it was good for what i liked games, coding, streaming. now all my hobbys and fun got surged in one move lol but i got my laptop from 2023 christmas i installed linux on it as a expirement and now im using this to code my games and learn to code ill save up for a new pc eventually but this is what i got so far. :( im sad about my pc 

day 2: instead of going with my text based rpg i asked chat gpt and a quick tutorial on how to use pygame and made this quick little boss figth where you walk up to the red square the boss press e figth turned based and b gives you a temp shield reduction on damage and def so its good and when you loose press 1 to try againa and 2 if you win to get a congrats screen so yea tmr i wanna make a text based rpg today is october 16 2025 and today i had the field trip not yesterday lol thats a message to me in the future ill get it maybe.
